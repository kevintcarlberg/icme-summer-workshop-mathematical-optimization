# Workshop Description
Mathematical optimization underpins many applications across science and
engineering, as it provides a set of formal tools to compute the ‘best’
action, design, control, or model from a set of possibilities. In data
science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, mathematical
optimization is the engine of model training and learning. This workshop will
provide an overview of the key elements of this topic (unconstrained,
constrained, convex optimization, optimization for model training), and will
have a practical focus, with participants formulating and solving optimization
problems early and often using standard modeling languages and solvers. By
introducing common models from machine learning and other fields, this
workshop aims to make participants comfortable with optimization tools so that
they may use it for rapid prototyping and experimentation in their own work.
Students should be comfortable with linear algebra, differential multivariable
calculus, and basic probability and statistics. Experience with Python will be
helpful, but not required.

Topics to be discussed in this workshop include:
* Formulating optimization problems
* Fundamentals of constrained and unconstrained optimization
* Convex optimization
* Optimization methods for model fitting in machine learning
* Optimization in Python using SciPy and CVXPY
* In-depth Jupyter Notebook examples from machine learning, statistics, and other fields.
